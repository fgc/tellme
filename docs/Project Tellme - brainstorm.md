* I want to make a simple clone of Daylio, something for my own personal use.  
*  It will be a database of my daily mood, activities and some notes, to track them.   
*  Later when I have more data I will add statistics and trends, but initially just tracking each day and a simple view of the past days will be enough.  
* I want it to run from my phone, no online component would be good, though I have options for free hosting if needed, can be browser based or either packaged in some way. I dont want to deal with native android development or the SDK, even less than with a host.  
* Data storage will be as simple as possible, but performant enough that I can later query efficiently for statistics. Should be easy to backup and restore.  
* No need for user management, this is strictly for my own usage, security should be very simple, just a hardcoded pin maybe.  
* The mood tracking will be a simple row of 5 icons ranging from great to awful, the activities an array of 15 to 20 where I can pick a few and then save the day  
*  After that I will be presented with a view of the moods and activities for the last week. I can go back to check on earlier weeks.  
*  Later we will add various views, graphs, trend analysis… but that’s for when we have some data
