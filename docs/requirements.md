Okay, this is a great starting point. The brainstorm provides a clear vision for a personal tool, and the technical spike offers a wealth of information to ground that vision in feasible technology.

Here's a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Project Tellme, incorporating the insights from both documents:

**Product Requirements Document: Project Tellme v1.0**

**1. Introduction**
Project Tellme is envisioned as a simple, personal, offline-first mobile-accessible application for daily mood and activity tracking. Inspired by applications like Daylio, its primary purpose is to allow the user to maintain a personal database of their emotional states, engaged activities, and brief notes. This data will initially be viewable for recent periods, with the long-term goal of enabling statistical analysis and trend identification. This document outlines the requirements for the initial version (v1.0) of Project Tellme.

**2. Goals and Objectives**
*   **Goal 1:** Provide a simple and quick way for the user to log their daily mood, activities, and notes.
*   **Goal 2:** Offer an intuitive interface to review mood and activity history for recent periods (e.g., the last week), with the ability to navigate to earlier weeks.
*   **Goal 3:** Ensure the application functions entirely offline, with no mandatory online component for core functionality.
*   **Goal 4:** Implement a basic security measure (PIN) to prevent casual unauthorized access.
*   **Goal 5:** Utilize simple, efficient, and easily manageable data storage suitable for future querying and backup/restore.
*   **Goal 6:** Build the application using web technologies to ensure accessibility from a mobile phone browser or as a Progressive Web App (PWA), avoiding native mobile development SDKs.

**3. Target Audience**
*   The sole user of this application is the individual commissioning it (referred to as "the user" henceforth). There is no requirement for multi-user support, user registration, or complex account management.

**4. Proposed Solution Overview**
Project Tellme v1.0 will be developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using a modern JavaScript framework. This approach aligns with the requirements for offline functionality, mobile phone accessibility without native SDKs, and potential for simple deployment.

*   **Frontend Technology:** Svelte (with SvelteKit) is recommended due to its performance, small bundle sizes, shallow learning curve, and excellent built-in support for service workers, which are crucial for PWA offline capabilities.
*   **Data Storage:** Client-side IndexedDB, managed via a wrapper library like Dexie.js. This provides robust offline storage for structured data, is performant enough for future querying, and allows for data export/import for backup/restore.
*   **Security:** A simple client-side PIN mechanism for application access.
*   **Deployment:** To be hosted on a free static site hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) or run locally.

**5. Detailed Features (v1.0)**

**5.1. Daily Entry Logging**
    *   **5.1.1. Mood Selection:**
        *   **Description:** The user can select their overall mood for the day.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   A horizontal row of 5 distinct icons representing moods from "Awful" to "Great" (or similar user-defined scale) is displayed.
            *   The user can tap one icon to select it.
            *   The selected mood is clearly visually indicated.
            *   Only one mood can be selected per entry.
    *   **5.1.2. Activity Selection:**
        *   **Description:** The user can select multiple activities they engaged in during the day.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   A predefined list/grid of 15-20 activity icons/labels is displayed.
            *   The user can tap multiple activities to select them.
            *   Selected activities are clearly visually indicated (e.g., highlighted, checkmark).
            *   The initial list of activities will be hardcoded but should be easily modifiable in the codebase for future customization.
    *   **5.1.3. Notes:**
        *   **Description:** The user can add a short text note to their daily entry.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   A text input field is available for adding notes.
            *   Notes are optional.
    *   **5.1.4. Save Entry:**
        *   **Description:** The user can save the selected mood, activities, and notes as a single entry for the current day.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   A "Save" button or equivalent action is present.
            *   Upon saving, the data is persisted to the local IndexedDB storage with a timestamp.
            *   The user receives confirmation that the entry has been saved.
            *   If an entry for the current day already exists, the system should allow editing/overwriting it (clarify preferred behavior: new entry or update existing). *Initial assumption: one entry per day, saving updates the existing entry for that day.*

**5.2. Data Viewing**
    *   **5.2.1. Current Week View:**
        *   **Description:** After saving an entry, or upon opening the app, the user is presented with a summary of moods and activities for the last 7 days.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   Displays daily entries for the current week (e.g., Monday to Sunday, or last 7 days from current date).
            *   Each day should visually represent the logged mood (e.g., using the selected icon).
            *   Logged activities for each day should be visible or easily accessible (e.g., icons, list on tap).
            *   If no entry exists for a day, it should be clearly indicated.
    *   **5.2.2. Historical Week Navigation:**
        *   **Description:** The user can navigate to view entries from previous weeks.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   Clear "Previous Week" / "Next Week" navigation controls are available.
            *   The view updates to show data for the selected week.
            *   Navigation should allow going back indefinitely as long as data exists.

**5.3. Security**
    *   **5.3.1. PIN Access:**
        *   **Description:** The application is protected by a simple PIN.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   On launching the app, the user is prompted to enter a PIN.
            *   The PIN will be hardcoded in the application's V1 codebase (as per brainstorm).
            *   Access to the application's main interface is granted only upon correct PIN entry.
            *   *Note: This provides a basic deterrent, not robust security for the data itself against a determined user with device access.*

**5.4. Data Management**
    *   **5.4.1. Data Backup (Export):**
        *   **Description:** The user can export their tracked data for backup purposes.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   An option in settings (or a dedicated section) allows the user to trigger a data export.
            *   Data is exported in a common, human-readable format (e.g., JSON).
            *   The exported file can be downloaded to the user's device.
    *   **5.4.2. Data Restore (Import):**
        *   **Description:** The user can import previously exported data.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
            *   An option in settings allows the user to select an exported data file (e.g., JSON).
            *   The application parses the file and imports the data into IndexedDB.
            *   A mechanism to handle potential duplicates or conflicts should be considered (e.g., overwrite, skip). *Initial assumption: import will overwrite existing data for the same timestamps or merge if timestamps are unique.*

**6. Technical Specifications**

*   **6.8. Deployment:** Static asset hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel free tier).

**7. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Considerations**

*   **7.1. Simplicity and Speed:** The primary UX goal is to make daily logging extremely quick and effortless.
*   **7.2. Visual Feedback:** Clear visual cues for selections, saved state, and navigation.
*   **7.3. Mood Icons:** Use universally understandable and distinct icons for moods.
*   **7.4. Activity Icons/Labels:** Visually distinct and easily recognizable.
*   **7.5. Readability:** Ensure text and icons are clear and legible on mobile screens.
*   **7.6. Navigation:** Intuitive navigation for weekly views.

**8. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **8.1. Performance:**
    *   Application should load quickly, even on slower connections (leveraging PWA caching).
    *   UI interactions should be smooth and responsive.
    *   Data queries for weekly views should be fast.
*   **8.2. Usability:**
    *   The application must be highly intuitive and require minimal learning.
    *   Data entry should be possible within seconds.
*   **8.3. Data Integrity:** Data saved by the user must be accurately stored and retrieved.
*   **8.4. Maintainability:** Code should be well-organized and commented to facilitate future updates.
*   **8.5. Scalability (Data):** While v1 is simple, the data storage solution (IndexedDB) should handle several years of daily entries without significant performance degradation for typical v1 views.

**9. Future Considerations (Post v1.0)**

*   Customizable activities list.
*   User-settable PIN (with considerations for secure client-side storage if possible, or acknowledgment of limitations).
*   Advanced statistics and trend analysis (graphs, charts, correlations).
*   More granular data views (monthly, yearly).
*   Search/filter functionality for entries.
*   Data encryption at rest (if a secure client-side key management solution is identified or desired).
*   Optional cloud synchronization (if user desires access across multiple devices, acknowledging complexity increase).

**10. Success Metrics (for personal use)**

*   Consistent daily usage by the user.
*   User satisfaction with the ease and speed of logging.
*   User ability to successfully review past entries as needed.
*   Successful data backup and restore operations.

**11. Open Questions / Assumptions**

*   **Assumption:** One entry per calendar day is sufficient. If multiple entries per day are needed, the schema and UI will need adjustment. (For V1, one entry per day is assumed).
*   **Assumption:** The initial list of 15-20 activities is fixed for V1.
*   **Question:** For editing an existing day's entry, should it simply overwrite, or should there be a more explicit edit mode? (Assumption: Overwrite is fine for V1).
*   **Clarification on PIN:** The "hardcoded PIN" is for application access control only and does not encrypt the underlying data in IndexedDB for v1.0.

User indicates all assumptions on point 11 are correct
